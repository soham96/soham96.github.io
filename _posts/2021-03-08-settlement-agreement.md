In this Project, we try to change pronouns based on the person's gender and preferred pronouns. We use Python and NLTK to do this. Below is an example of a legal document where a tool like this might be useful.





## SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

**FOR AND IN CONSIDERATION** of the person stated Ms Jane Doe and (i) the Judicial system of the state of Texas, and (i) Public Works Department, and (iii) Public Judiciary Court System and (iv) Board of Public Members, enter into the following Agreement:

### RECITALS

- Ms Jane Doe is an engineer, in the electrical engineering department under the Public Works Department(PWD) from 19 March 2011 to 20th Feb 2021

- Ms Jane Doe is a transgender man. Although she was assigned the female sex at birth, she asserts herself as male gender and deeply associates with it

- As part of her being employee, she wanted to apply for gender transforming surgery, which was denied under the Civil Acts 1930 and under her insurance plan, 1806056 Employee Health Records

- Ms Jane Doe then filed a complaint in the District Court in the State of Texas Case Number 500090034. She alleges the denial of treatment on the basis of her gender which violates the gender equality and recognition law(identified as U7867790)

- Defendant and Respondent deny that they have violated any law regarding Ms Jane Doe

### AGREEMENT

The parties have agreed it is in their best interest to resolve the issue amongst themselves without any litigation. Therefore this Settlement Agreement is governed with the intent of resolving the matters between them and hence both parties will agree to the following:

1. The Public Works Department will now recognise Ms Jane Doe as of the male gender and hence will settle all claims against Ms Jane Doe regarding the validation and arising facts from the Recital above.

2. In the interest of solving the issue, the state of Texas will now cover gender alerting surgeries that she needs under Public Employees Benefits Board Statewide Health Plan
